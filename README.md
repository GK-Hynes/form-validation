# Form Validation

A form built to practice form validation using regular expressions. Built for Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/).

The form tests for character-limited names, valid Eircodes (Irish zipcodes), valid email addresses, and valid phone numbers.
